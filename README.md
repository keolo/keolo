# Hi, I’m Keolo 🤙

I build things that scale—from 0→1 MVPs to globally distributed teams delivering secure, AI-powered products. Over the last 20+ years, I’ve helped launch **25+ startups**, many have gone on to exit, and shipped software that’s reached **millions of users** (including an OSS library with 4M+ downloads).

## What I Do

* 🚀 **Fractional CTO / Advisor** — partner with founders to turn ideas into revenue-generating products.
* 🧠 **Tech Strategy** — align engineering with business goals, ensuring compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA, HITRUST) and capability.
* 🌍 **Team Builder** — scale distributed teams while keeping attrition <1%.
* ⚙️ **Systems Engineer** — from AI/ML data pipelines to microservices at enterprise scale.
