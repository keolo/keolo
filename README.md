## Hi, I'm Keolo ðŸ¤™

With over 20 years of product/engineering/strategy experience, I've had the privilege of driving innovation and delivering impactful solutions across startups, mid-market, and enterprise environments. My journey spans contributions to over 15 startups, including 5 successful exits (as an IC/Manager), and remarkably, millions of downloads for my open-source library, `mixpanel_client`.

### What I Do

I specialize in crafting **data-driven, cross-platform, people-first technology** that leverages advanced AI and cloud engineering. My expertise lies in building scalable systems, leading globally distributed teams, and turning ideas into successful ventures.
