With over 20 years of product/engineering/strategy experience, I've had the privilege of driving innovation and delivering impactful solutions across startups, mid-market, and enterprise environments. My journey spans contributions to 15+ startups, including 5 successful exits (as an IC/Manager), and remarkably, millions of downloads for my open-source library, `mixpanel_client`.
